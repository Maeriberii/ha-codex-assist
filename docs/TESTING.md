# Testing

## Automated checks

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q
```

The fast suite under `tests/` uses lightweight Home Assistant fakes. Run the `tests_ha/` suite in an isolated Python 3.14 environment so it does not reuse the normal project environment:

```bash
uv run --isolated --python 3.14 --with-requirements requirements_test_ha.txt \
  python -m pytest tests_ha -q

uv run --isolated --python 3.14 --with-requirements requirements_test_ha_min.txt \
  python -m pytest tests_ha -q
```

CI runs the fast suite plus real-Home-Assistant contract lanes against both the
latest release and Home Assistant 2026.5.0, the minimum supported version. The
latest-version lane also runs weekly to catch upstream breakage.

## Release-candidate install

1. Download the branch or tag archive to test.
2. Back up the installed integration.
3. Copy `custom_components/codex_assist` to `/config/custom_components/codex_assist`.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Confirm the integration version and logs reflect the candidate.

To roll back, reinstall the latest stable release through HACS and restart Home Assistant.

## Assist smoke test

After restarting Home Assistant:

1. Confirm `conversation.codex_assist` exists.
2. Select Codex Assist in an Assist pipeline.
3. Ask a read-only question and ask it to list exposed entities.
4. Test one harmless exposed light.
5. Confirm sensitive entities remain unexposed unless deliberately allowed.

## Authentication and model tests

When auth or model handling changes:

- verify invalidated credentials produce a clear reauthentication path;
- complete device-code sign-in and confirm the existing config entry resumes;
- confirm logs do not expose tokens, cookies, or device codes;
- verify fallback models appear when discovery is unavailable;
- verify authenticated model discovery when the backend supports it;
- verify a stale saved model falls back safely;
- verify discovery failure does not block setup.

## AI Task and media tests

Home Assistant's normal Assist popup may not expose file uploads. Use AI Task surfaces for native attachment testing.

1. Confirm the Codex Assist AI Task entity exists.
2. Call `ai_task.generate_data` with a small local image or camera attachment and verify the response uses its contents.
3. Call `ai_task.generate_image` with a plain prompt and one non-default size.
4. Confirm text-only Assist still works afterward.
5. Confirm logs do not contain tokens, local file contents, or base64 payloads.

Codex Assist accepts up to four image attachments, with a 10 MiB per-image limit and
a 20 MiB aggregate limit per request. Requests over the count or aggregate limit fail
instead of silently discarding attachments.

Before publishing screenshots, remove private URLs, account details, tokens, device codes, and private entity or dashboard names.
